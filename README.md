# inlamensterms.io website

This repo contains all of the content for the [InLaymansTerms.io](inlaymansterms.io) website.

Feel free to contribute any of your own descriptions. 
We can work on those together and get them published with your social handles and bio :).

The website is built using [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and primarily [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/).

To contribute, you do not need to know any of the above technologies, 
as all content is written purely MarkDown,
and to contribute content / improvements to content only requires changing the Markdown files.

Have a look in `content/articles` to see how simple a Layman is.

## Contributing

The easiest way to contribute is to add more content, or review / improve existing content.

Most content lives in `content/articles`

Each file has the title, description, and author information for a particular post.

The generation of the website happens automatically on merging to master. 

Don't feel too worried about publishing perfect content. If you think it could be remotely interesting, 
feel free to add even just the basics, and we can work together to flesh out the content.

If you feel anxious about writing content, but think there is something you'd like to see a Layman for, 
feel free to open an issue with your idea, and we can work on building the content.

Once you have something to contribute, feel free to open a PR, and we can review it together, 
make it pretty, get it published and shared.
